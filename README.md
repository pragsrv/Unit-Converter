You can add custom units only for **Length** and **Mass** categories.  
Temperature units involve formulas and aren't supported for custom entries.

Example:

> Unit name: `lightyear`  
> Value in base unit (e.g., meters): `9.461e+15`

Once added, `lightyear` appears in the dropdown and can be deleted anytime.
